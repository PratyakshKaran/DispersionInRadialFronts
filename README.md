# DispersionInRadialFronts
Solves the reactive transport in radial fronts in homogeneous porous media at the Darcy scale, focussing on the consequences of hydrodynamic/mechanical dispersion Refs: Impact of hydrodynamic dispersion on mixing-induced reactions under radial flow, and, Effect of hydrodynamic dispersion on spherical reaction front dynamics in porous medias
